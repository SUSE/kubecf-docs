To see the docs referring to internals or specific code areas of **KubeCF**, we
recommend looking at:
  https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubecf/tree/master/doc

A good starting point is the doc's Contribution guide, and its directory
[organization table](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubecf/blob/master/doc/Contribute.md#source-organization).

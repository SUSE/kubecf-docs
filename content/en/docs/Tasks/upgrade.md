  How to upgrade KubeCF
---

## Upgrading from a previous deployment

Upgrading is roughly the same as doing an [initial deployment]; however, please
use `helm upgrade` intead of `helm install`.

If you are providing a configuration file that was originally from a previous
deployment, please take care to review the configuration to ensure you are not
maintaining default values from a previous version unintentionally.  Where
possible, not specifying configuration that maintains the default values will
prevent accidentally changing them if the defaults have changed in the new
version.

## Upgrading from SCF

Please refer to the [SUSE documentation].  Exporting data from the SCF
insallation and importing into KubeCF is required.
